# Maneuverable Piccolissimo 4 (MP4) Test Platform Setup Guide

Maneuverable Piccolissimo 4 test platform, or MP4 test platform for short, is a single motor drone system designed to test the dynamics of the drone before we build the full distributed version of MP4 system. Instead of using peer-to-peer communication between drones to achieve control like it will be in the MP4 system, this test platform uses external optical tracking system like Optitrack to obtain high accuracy drone position, making it easier to test subsystems like aerodynamics or control.

For more details of this system, please check (and cite!) our paper at [RSS proceedings website](https://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss20/p102.html). For assembly guide, please visit [this document](https://1drv.ms/w/s!Aq5Al0CEiWQnkfE0qJTTQATZVnzniQ).
