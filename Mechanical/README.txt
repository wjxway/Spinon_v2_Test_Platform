If you want to change the design or look at it in more detail, go to:

These parts need to be printed using properly dried PAHT-CF filament using BambuLab X1C printer. (If the filament is just opened, then its dry. If it has been left out for a while, then it needs to be dried. You can use the printer's dry filament utility to dry the filament.)

To print the chassis and the wings, import the process presets in Bambu Studio by Files -> Import -> Import presets. When printing the chassis, select the preset "Chassis" and when printing the wings, select the preset "Wings".

The launcher parts can be printed however you want (PLA+standard settings would work just fine). Just note that Launcher_soft need to be printed using TPU.
