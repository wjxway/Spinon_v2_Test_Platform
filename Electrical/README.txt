CAM_Files.zip contains the CAM files needed to manufacture and assemble the PCB.

In the schematics, I'm using pinhead as power plugs and SSM6K504NU FET instead of the G2014.
When building the board, make sure you do not install the pinhead (use wires with headers instead) and install Goford G2014 FET.
